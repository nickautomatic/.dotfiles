## SMARTER TAB-COMPLETION (Readline bindings) ##
##
## largely lifted from Paul Irish:
## https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles/blob/main/.inputrc

# Display matches for ambiguous patterns at first tab press
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# Immediately add a trailing slash when autocompleting symlinks to directories
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# Display the common prefix of the set of possible completions using a different color
set colored-completion-prefix on

# Display possible completions using different colors to indicate their file type
set colored-stats on

# Use the text that has already been typed as the prefix for searching through
# commands (basically more intelligent Up/Down behavior)
"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)
set skip-completed-text on

# Allow UTF-8 input and output
set input-meta on
set output-meta on

# Use Alt + Delete to delete the next word
"\e[3;3~": kill-word

# Include system-wide inputrc, which is ignored by default when
# a user has their own .inputrc file.
$include /etc/inputrc
